### Abstract of the Original Paper:
The paper presents a multitask cascaded convolutional network (MTCNN) for joint face detection and alignment. This method integrates the detection and alignment process into a unified architecture, which significantly enhances the accuracy and speed of facial landmark localization. The system uses a three-stage network to predict face locations and landmarks iteratively, improving the results progressively across each stage.

## Original MTCNN Repository

This library is based on the original implementation by Kaipeng Zhang, who made the pretrained networks and the code available for the research community. If you are using the models or weights provided in this library, you may also consider citing the original GitHub repository:

This repository includes the source code, pre-trained weights, and additional information related to the original MTCNN framework, all released under the MIT license.

## Related Work

This project also draws inspiration from the **FaceNet's MTCNN implementation** by David Sandberg. This implementation is part of a larger face recognition framework called FaceNet, which uses the MTCNN architecture to handle the task of face alignment prior to recognition.
