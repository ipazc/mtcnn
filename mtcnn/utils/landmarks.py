def adjust_landmarks(face_landmarks, bboxes_batch):
    """
    Adjusts face landmark coordinates to align them with the corresponding bounding boxes.
    
    The face landmarks are scaled and shifted based on the width and height of the bounding boxes
    to ensure that they are correctly aligned with the face locations.

    Args:
        face_landmarks (np.ndarray or tf.Tensor): An array of shape (n, 10) where each row represents 
                                                  the normalized coordinates of 5 facial landmarks 
                                                  (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5). These 
                                                  coordinates are normalized between 0 and 1.
        bboxes_batch (np.ndarray): An array of bounding boxes of shape (n, m), where each row contains
                                   the bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] and possibly additional
                                   columns (e.g., image id, confidence score).

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The adjusted face landmark coordinates, now scaled and positioned relative to the 
                    corresponding bounding boxes.
